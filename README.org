* Introduction
  I was a vimer before, I used the best editor in this planet. One day, a guy
  told me that there is also an awesome editor here, which is better than Vim/Vi
  (IMO, In some way, I don't want to start a holy war). What always convinced me
  is that Vim is the best, but action is loader than words. I could only defeat
  this guy that Vim is best after I try Emacs. Finally, I try Emacs for half of
  a year and I turn to be an Emacser :)
* Install
  Before install this .emacs.d, make sure you have backup your configuration.
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    git clone https://github.com/ramsayleung/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC
  And then run ~dependency.sh~ to install dependencies
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    bash dependency.sh
  #+END_SRC
* Features
** Evil
   Even though I am an Emacser now, I have to admit that the way Vim edit file
   is the most efficent way, so there is no need to give it up. By the way, it
   is said that Emacs is "a great operating system, lacking only a decent
   ediotr", now I have Evil, I have them both.
** Company
   As for the completion framework, my choice is company-mode. Althoug
   auto-complete has better document, but company is easier to setup and less
   brittle
