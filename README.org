A personal Emacs configuration refined over nearly 10 years, combining Vim's modal editing efficiency with Emacs's unparalleled extensibility.

* Philosophy & Background
  - Starting as a Vim user, I was drawn to Emacs for its extensibility and have been refining this configuration for almost a decade. While I use IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code for professional Java/Rust work, Emacs remains my go-to for side projects (Rust, Python, Ruby, TypeScript) and all writing tasks.

  - My workflow centers around =org-mode= for blogging (published to [[https://github.com/ramsayleung/ramsayleung.github.io][GitHub Pages]] via =ox-hugo= and Hugo) and =Magit= for version control—both have become indispensable extensions of my workflow. The configuration has evolved from vanilla Emacs to Spacemacs and back, ultimately embracing the philosophy: *keep it simple, usable, and productive.*

* Key Features

  - *Evil Mode*: Vim keybindings and modal editing at the core
  - *Org-mode Mastery*: Complete blogging workflow from drafting to publishing
  - *Magit Integration*: Seamless Git operations deeply integrated into the editing flow
  - *Multi-language Support*: Robust development environment for various programming languages
  - *Extensive Snippets*: =yasnippet= templates for 15+ languages (C++, Python, Rust, JavaScript, etc.)
  - *Modular Architecture*: Organized into logical components covering:
    - Auto-completion and syntax checking
    - Ivy for efficient navigation
    - Enhanced editing behaviors
    - Shell integration (Eshell)
    - Custom keybindings
    - UI refinements

* Quick Start

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramsayleung/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

  Launch Emacs—it will automatically set up the environment and download packages on first run.

  *Note*: This is a personal configuration. Explore and adapt it to your needs!

* Essential Keybindings

  - =C-x C-f=: Open files (with Ivy completion)
  - Vim keybindings via Evil mode, leader-key =Space=
  - =C-x g=: Magit status
  - Standard Org-mode workflows for =.org= files
