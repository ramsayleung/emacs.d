A personal Emacs configuration refined over nearly 10 years, combining Vim's modal editing efficiency with Emacs's unparalleled extensibility.

* Philosophy & Background
  - Starting as a Vim user, I was drawn to Emacs for its extensibility and have been refining this configuration for almost a decade. While I use IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code for professional Java/Rust work, Emacs remains my go-to for side projects (Rust, Python, Ruby, TypeScript) and all writing tasks.

  - My workflow centers around =org-mode= for blogging (published to [[https://github.com/ramsayleung/ramsayleung.github.io][GitHub Pages]] via =ox-hugo= and Hugo) and =Magit= for version control—both have become indispensable extensions of my workflow. The configuration has evolved from vanilla Emacs to Spacemacs and back, ultimately embracing the philosophy: *keep it simple, usable, and productive.*

* What's in the box?
  - It acts like Vim: I can't live without modal editing, so that’s the foundation.
  - A full blog publishing workflow: I use this to write and deploy my actual blog.
  - Git without the pain: Version control is part of the flow, not a separate chore.
  - Ready to code: I've pre-configured it for languages I use daily (Python, Rust, C++, etc.) with plenty of snippets to save keystrokes.
  - It's tidy: I hate messy configs, so I've organized everything into logical chunks—from Ivy for navigation to UI tweaks and Eshell integration.

* Quick Start

  #+BEGIN_SRC bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramsayleung/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
  #+END_SRC

  Launch Emacs—it will automatically set up the environment and download packages on first run.

  *Note*: This is a personal configuration. Explore and adapt it to your needs!

* Essential Keybindings

  - =C-x C-f=: Open files (with Ivy completion)
  - Vim keybindings via Evil mode, leader-key =Space=
  - =C-x g=: Magit status
  - Standard Org-mode workflows for =.org= files
